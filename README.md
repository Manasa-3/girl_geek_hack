Create a messaging app with end to end encryption. The app will have two modes, one for normal usage and one for confidential purposes. 
The confidential mode will not backup anything and messages will dissappear after a certain time.
It will also consist of IP whitelisting. 
If time permits, we will implement secure file storage on the app.
